## Introduction
Python script to compute various aspects of the birthday paradox using both analytical equations and Monte Carlo simulations.

Given a group of ùëõ people and assuming a year has ùëë possible birthday days (typically 365 days for people born on Earth), the script calculates the following parameters:	
  - Probability of not shared birthdays in the group
  - Probability of at least one shared birthday
  - Expected number of people with unique birthdays
  - Expected number of people with shared birthdays

The calculations assume that each birthday is equally probable.

Additionally, the script can be adapted for other applications by treating ùëõ as the number of observations and ùëë as the number of possible combinations. For example, it can be used to analyze scenarios such as the number of barcodes observed and the number of possible barcode combinations (refer to [FidelityFinder](https://github.com/RTlabCBM/FidelityFinder) for more information on barcode applications in bioinformatics).

## Quick Start
The program is available as a Jupyter Notebook. It can be opened and run with the following Google Colab link: [birthday_paradox](https://colab.research.google.com/github/javiermardelrio/BirthdayParadox/blob/main/JupyterNotebooks/birthday_paradox.ipynb)

## Input Parameters

Parameters that can be provided as input together with example values:

- Number of people in a group (n)
```console
n = 23
```
- Number of days in a year (d)
```console
d = 365
```
- Number of simulations (s)
```console
s = 100000
```

## Sample Output Results
Here is an example of the output data generated using the above input parameters:
